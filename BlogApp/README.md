# BlogSpace 📝  
A personal full-stack MERN blogging platform built from scratch.

## 📌 About the Project

**BlogSpace** is my personal project developed to practice and demonstrate my skills in building a complete server-side rendered MERN application.

The platform allows users to create an account, log in securely, and manage blogs with full CRUD functionality. Users can also interact with other posts by liking and commenting on blogs.

This project focuses on:
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Authentication and authorization
- User interaction (likes & comments)
- Clean UI and smooth user experience

It was built as part of my learning journey in full-stack web development.
