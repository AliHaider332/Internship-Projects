The app begins with a sign-up page where users enter their details, followed by a verification step requiring them to re-enter specific information such as the password. Some details are pre-filled from the initial sign-up, with only a few additional inputs required. Once validated, the app computes and displays the user's daily caloric needs in a simple, user-friendly format. Built as a classroom-recommended project to practice desktop app development and health-related calculations.",
